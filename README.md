# Li'l Brother

Li'l Brother tracks clicks on web pages, without blocking any interaction.

## Client

Include the library:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://server/lilbro.js"></script>
```

Listen for clicks on the body:
```javascript
var lilBro = new LilBro({
  element: document.body,
  server: 'server:8000',
  ssl_server: 'server:8443',
  track_focus: true
});
```

Alternatively, listen for a specific event, and annotate the message with custom data:

```javascript
// register a click handler that snakes some data from the DOM,
// and specifies the the event type.
// This wont bubble to the wrapper element being watched.
lilBro.watch({
  element: document.getElementById('search_button'),
  callback: function(e) {
    e.set(
      'element_value',
      document.getElementById('search_term').value
    );
   	e.set('event_type', 'search');
  }
});
```

Or fire an event, right now:

```javascript
lilBro.write({event_type: 'page_load'});
```

## Server

Start up the node listener and write events to a log file:

```
$ bin/lilbro --output-file lilb.log
```
